## BattleHack Los Angeles
---

#### **HTML5, JavaScript, JSON** | *28 February 2015 - 1 March 2015* | Santa Monica, CA

This event, organized by [Braintree], was a blast. Going into the hackathon without a team, I knew
that I would face challenges. After forming a team with some colleagues from school (who I was not
expecting to be there) we got to work hashing out ideas. Eventually, we decided on building a web
platform designed to assist non-profits in connecting with their target audience. 

Despite deciding to axe our project at the very end of the competition, I had a great time and
learned tons. Ultimately, this project was agreat learning experience, and I came away from the
event with an idea I hope to pursue and build upon in the future.

## Conway's Game of Life
---

#### **Java** | *10 January 2015 - 14 January 2015*

This personal project is one I had been meaning to get around to for a while. Naturally I decided my
birthday would be a great day to start a new project. Day one included very little productivity,
however by day two I had a functioning game which relied on the command line to convey game data,
with a poorly-constructed ASCII universe. Day three brought a GUI into the mix, and day four brought
significant optimization to the game. Conway's Game of Life, while relatively simple, was a fun
problem to solve!

## Introduction to Computer Science
---

#### **Swift** | *4 January 2015* | Apple Store, Berkeley, CA

A lecture taught by yours truly, to a few dozen Apple employees! My primary goal was to provide both
a deeper understanding of computer hardware and software, and give an overview of the programming
process, with a brief live demonstration of some simple scripting in Swift. Overall an awesome
experience, this opportunity helped strengthen my own existing knowledge of the topics discussed,
and helped to improve my public speaking skills. Despite having two years of experience with improv,
from a club in high school, and despite spending the second year as president of said club, I don't
consider public speaking one of my strong suits.

## Ludum Dare 30
---

#### **C#** | *22 August 2014 - 25 August 2014*

My first experience with a game jam, Ludum Dare was an awesome adventure. A 48-hour (competitive,
solo) or 72-hour (relaxed, group) game development hackathon, I viewed Ludum Dare as a great way to
put my rapid development skills to the test.

Teaming up with the invaluable Anthony Becker ([@b_cker]) and the
indispensable Bethany Barker ([@BethhhJB]), [Earth<->Krethys] was born. A 2-D platformer with a
twist; as Kale you have the ability to traverse between two parallel but vastly differing worlds,
and use this unique skill to complete each level.

I learned tons, had a blast, and did so with great company. I can't wait to do this again.

## Machine Learning Research Project
---

#### **Python, C++, MatLab, Java** | *April 2014 - Present*

With oversight and mentoring from Dr. Ehsan Kamalinejad, Professor of Mathematics at CSU East Bay,
and alongside Anthony Becker ([@b_cker]), the purpose of this research work is to explore the realm
of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and their real-world applications.

## GameGame, the Game
---

#### **C++** | *August 2013 - December 2013*

One of my first large-scale* personal projects, my objective with this oh-so-creatively-named
text-based adventure game  was to familiarize myself with the language. Having moved from Southern
California, and a community college which favored Java, to Northern California and CSU East Bay
(which favors C++) I deemed it necessary to give myself a self-driven primer of the latter of the
languages. This project was a valuable introduction to both the importance of personal projects, and
the C++ language.

###### *large-scale, at the time, meant over 2000 lines of handwritten code

## Hack for Change 2012
---

#### Tiny amounts of **Objective-C** | *July 2012* | San Francisco, California

As a programming newbie, with more textbook knowledge than practical knowledge or experience, I dove
into this headfirst knowing all too well that I would probably be completely overwhelmed. All the
same, I decided rather on a whim that this was going to be my first hackathon. I was hungry for
experience, and figured that it would be an amazing opportunity, even if it meant just watching over
the shoulders of the experts I was certain would be present for such an event.

[Hack for Change], hosted by [Change.org] did not disappoint, and thanks to the endless patience of
Frederic Jacobs ([@FredericJacobs]), I didn't feel *completely* useless. Working with a team of a
little over [half a dozen extremely talented people], we managed to put together a mobile
application called LivePort, an instant, live reporting tool designed to help people in conflict
areas stay safe.

Our submission took home an API award from [tokbox], for best use of their OpenTok API!

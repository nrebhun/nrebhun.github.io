   So it's been a little while since my last update, and I guess I have some
news! I've finished all the courses necessary (and then some) to earn my
degree! I am told the paperwork should be finished processing mid-march, and
shortly after a piece of paper will make its way to my mailbox, telling anyone
who reads it that I know how to do Science with computers. Huzzah!

    This effectively means I'm kicking the job hunt into high gear. Meanwhile,
I'm also ramping up on a personal project, in the hopes of gaining a firm grasp
on JavaScript, Node, and React. Look out, world! I'm looking to change you for
the better, and I'll do everything I can to maket that a reality!

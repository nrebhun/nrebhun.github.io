I made it to Bologna! My flight ended up arriving almost an hour early, so I switched my train
ticket for an earlier train from Milan to Bologna, and was on my way! By the I met up with my aunt,
it was about 12:30 local time. I had been traveling since about 10:30 Eastern, the previous
morning, and despite having been on the move for about 16 hours, I'm operating on about 1.5 hours
of sleep (I think 16 hours... tired brain is convincing me it's not worth checking my math right
now.)

Anyways, after a small tour around Bologna and a **severely** necessary shower, my aunt and I
walked from her house into town, in part to help me stay awake, but mostly to run a number of small
errands. Along the way I picked up a SIM card for the trip and grabbed some gelato, which was
pretty great. I got a small cone, which still came with two scoops of any flavor. I went with
_mango e cioccolato_, a bit of a weird combo, but the dark chocolate ended up complementing the
sweet mango nicely.

After returning from the walk/errands, I collapsed on the bed in the guest room, and worked very
hard not to pass out; it was only 16:00, and I wasn't going to let jet lag get me this time. A
little while later, my aunt offered to make a sauce with pasta for dinner, which I gladly agreed
to, hoping the food would fuel me for even an hour longer. The pasta was excellent. Not too
showy or over-the-top with flavors, simply mushroom, spinach, and sausage, with a little low fat
cream, topped with fresh parmesan.

In an unrelated note, a few minutes ago I got an email for [Hacktoberfest]. If you've never done
that before, you **absolutely** should! It's a lot of fun! I'm even going to try earning my t-shirt
during my travels.

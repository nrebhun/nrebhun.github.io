After several months of applications, interviews and fantastic learning experiences, I have
officially received an offer of employment for a career in my field! **I could not be more
excited.**

So! June 3rd will be my final day as a mobile technician at the Apple Store, though I highly doubt
it will be the last Apple sees of me. My start date as an Automation Engineering Intern with [Dun &
Bradstreet] is June 15th, which gives me enough time to visit friends in the Bay Area and attend my
graduation ceremony on June 12th before getting started.

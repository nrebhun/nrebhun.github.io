## Sat. June 29, 2024 (Afternoon)

Alright well, I got myself into a bit of a pickle, and then got myself back out again.

Gathered some wood, harvested a few rounds of crops and sorted those away, did some misc. intermediate crafting, upgraded my basic `ironbackpacks` bag to gold-tier, to really make that a little more worth having, smelted some more metals, then decided to break back into the nether.

In anticipation of Nether death, I outfitted myself with vanilla iron armor.

Grabbed a bunch of cobblestone, crafted a ridiculous amount of stairs, grabbed a few more stacks of cobble, and resolved to carve out a safe spawn area around the portal, on the nether-side.

Oh, and on the way down to the overworld portal, I sectioned off our area from the cave system with walls and doors, and paved the run with steps to make trips up and down faster and easier.

BUT once in the nether, after throwing together a simple cobblestone room...

I did some deep nether exploration to try to find a Blaze spawner, 
- so that we can farm **Blaze Rods**,
  - so that we can build a **blast furnace**,
    - so that we can turn **iron into steel**,
      - so that we can smelt a **steel pickaxe head** (our gateway to the future)
        - so that we can mine **cobalt**, 
          - so that we can outfit ourselves the highest-tier tools possible

Ugh. We're going to need quite a few blaze rods.
By my calculations, we'll need at least 18 of those suckers.

I ran around in the Nether so long that I nearly ran out of food. I was about to turn back when I actually came across a Nether Fortress

Broke into that thing, carefully killed a few wither skeletons, less-carefully killed a couple of random Blazes, consumed the last of my food in the process and was about to give up... but then I realized I didn't actually know my way back.

Checked the map, and the shortest route back to the portal was literally straight through the fortress, and then presumably a little ways beyond that... so I decided to try my luck sprinting through the fortress undetected.

Nearly died a few times, but I made it to the other side of the lava lake, where I also happened across a blaze spawner! I marked it on my map, partially walled it off so that we wouldn't accidentally get swarmed by the blazes, and moved on.

Not 100 meters away, I hit a stairway Ben carved that essentially leads right back to our portal.

All of that, and I walked away clutching a single blaze rod.
Just 17 more to go!

I didn't actually accomplish much it feels like... went hunting for candleberries and failed

Ended up building an apiary to harvest wax, to make hardened leather, to craft a disappointing backpack that I think probably wasn't worth it. 

So I started looking into applied energistics stuff, and realized how badly we need redstone, glowstone, nether quartz, and charged certus quartz... so I ignited the portal and made a short trip to the nether

Oh and I made a bunch of iron chests for more dense storage

But yeah we're going to need a ridiculous amount of redstone, gold, and glowstone

And we're going to need a blast furnace soon, which is another multi-block structure like the coke oven... ugh. 

And there's crazy stuff in the nether, like cobalt. If we can harvest that and add it to our tinkers construct equipment, it will be a very good thing

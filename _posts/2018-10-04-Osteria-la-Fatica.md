Today was fairly slow, mostly spent walking around downtown Bologna, planning the next several days and recovering from the yesterdayâ€™s hike. For dinner, however, I met and joined many new friends in their celebration of the end of their first year of med school. I joined the group in completely occupying the _Osteria la Fatica_. It was a lot of fun joining in  various regional tavern songs with the students, and talking with them about their experiences.

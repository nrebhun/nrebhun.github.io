Okay I haven't posted in absolutely forever. It's been a **busy** year. Whew, now that's out of the way...

Anyways, this post is a shout-out to the awesome folks at Github, for enabling HTTPS on Github pages sites with custom domains! As described in [their 2016 blog post], HTTPS has been available as a simple checkbox for Github Pages sites for quite some time. A little over a year ago, I sunk a few hours into trying to set up my own Pages site with HTTPS, and was ultimately unsuccessful. Having a custom domain was/is pretty important to me, but so was allowing any stray visitors to access my site securely.

So for the longest time, I was stuck, and left things as they were; a custom domain to feel a bit
more like this was *my* corner of the internet, and no secure site.

Today, however, [Github announced] support for HTTPS for users with custom domains! So now you, dear reader, get the best of both worlds: a secure connection to my website (for whatever reason) and the experience of a website that truly feels like it's something that took me internet wizardry to obtain.

In case you're worried or curious, [it's not actually magic].

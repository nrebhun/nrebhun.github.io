I am incredibly excited to announce that I have accepted an offer of employment from Apple!
Apple has been a significant goal for me since I began tinkering with code, and I almost can't
believe it's happening. For obvious reasons, I won't be able to discuss my work, but I will try to
maintain my site a little more than I have, discussing books I'm reading, interesting articles I've
found and my thoughts on them, etc.

Where I'll find the time for this, I have no idea... but I am going to try.

I don't begin this next adventure until the end of October, so starting this Monday I will be
traveling. First, about a week jumping around the east coast, visiting friends and family, and then
I am off to Italy!

I'm currently working on updates to my site which will allow me to post writings in a separate
feed to those found on the front page... so stay tuned!

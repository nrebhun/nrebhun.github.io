Hi, I'm Nick! I hail from Los Angeles, have been programming since I was about 16, and graduated
from CSU East Bay with a B.S. in Computer Science.

In the summer of 2016, I began my software engineering adventure with [Dun & Bradstreet] in Malibu,
California as an automation intern.

Post-internship, I remained an automation engineer for about a year before exploring the world
of web development through a full-stack position on one of the D&B AppDev teams. I continued
learning and growing with the excellent folks at Dun & Bradstreet for a little over a year more,
before moving on to my latest adventure.

More recently, I have accepted an offer of employment from [Apple], and I couldn't be more excited!
Engineering at Apple has long been my dream... I can't wait to see what the future holds.

I am endlessly curious, and fuel said curiosity by tinkering with one of far too many personal
projects, and researching topics of interest such as, in no particular order: physics, space
exploration, neuroscience, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, operating systems, etc...

##### etc...

Also, I enjoy making games, and participate in Ludum Dare every now and then. My first hackathon
was Hack for Change 2012, where I assisted with the creation of LivePort. You can see more about my
projects [here](/projects/)!

I love my girlfriend Gabby very much!

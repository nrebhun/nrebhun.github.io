Hi, I'm Nick! I have been programming since I was 16, and am currently a student at CSU East Bay. I
anticipate graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science by Summer 2015! I'm
currently working on a research project involving Machine Learning.

I have a deep interest for nearly all areas of science, though I find physics particularly exciting!
I also enjoy making games, and participate in Ludum Dare as frequently as I can! My first hackathon
was Hack for Change 2012, where I assisted with the creation of LivePort. You can see more about my
projects in the so-named page of my site.

I love my girlfriend, Gabby, very much!

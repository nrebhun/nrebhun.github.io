Hi, I'm Nick! I have been programming since I was 16, **recently graduated
from CSU East Bay, with a B.S. in Computer Science**, and am now on the hunt
for a career in my field.

I have a deep interest for all areas of science, though I find physics particularly exciting!
I also enjoy making games, and participate in Ludum Dare as frequently as I can! My first hackathon
was Hack for Change 2012, where I assisted with the creation of LivePort. You can see more about my
projects in the so-named page of my site.

I love my girlfriend Gabby very much!

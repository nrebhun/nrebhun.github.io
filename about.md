Hi, I'm Nick! I am currently a student at CSU East Bay, studying Computer Science.

I enjoy making games, and participate in Ludum Dare as frequently as I can! My first hackathon was Hack for Change 2012, where I assisted with the creation of LivePort. You can see more about my projects in the so-named page of my site (once I'm finished with it).

I love my girlfriend, Gabby, very much!

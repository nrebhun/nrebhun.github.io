Hi, I'm Nick! I have been programming since I was 16, graduated from CSU East Bay, with a
B.S. in Computer Science, and recently began my software engineering adventure with an internship
at [Dun & Bradstreet]. During the internship, I was formally offered a position on the Automation
team, and have since enjoyed learning and growing in this role alongside an amazing group of people.

I have a deep interest for all areas of science, though I find physics particularly exciting.
I also enjoy making games, and participate in Ludum Dare as frequently as I can! My first hackathon
was Hack for Change 2012, where I assisted with the creation of LivePort. You can see more about my
projects in the so-named page of my site.

I love my girlfriend Gabby very much!

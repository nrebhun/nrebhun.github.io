Hi, I'm Nick! I have been programming since about 16, graduated from CSU East Bay with a
B.S. in Computer Science, and recently began my software engineering adventure with an internship
at [Dun & Bradstreet]. During the internship, I was formally offered a position on the Automation
team, and have since enjoyed learning and growing in this role alongside an amazing group of people.

More recently, I have been brought onto the WebApp development team, where I am gaining invaluable
experience with effective cross-functional team communication, creating projects from scratch,
designing and implementing efficient supporting infrastructure, and more. I hope to write about some
of my design decisions in this role in the near future.

I am endlessly curious, and fuel said curiosity by tinkering on one of far too many personal
projects, and researching topics of interest such as: (in no particular order) physics, space
exploration, neuroscience, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, operating systems, etc...

##### etc...

Also, I enjoy making games, and participate in Ludum Dare as every now and then. My first hackathon
was Hack for Change 2012, where I assisted with the creation of LivePort. You can see more about my
projects [here](/projects/)!

I love my girlfriend Gabby very much!

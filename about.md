Hi, I'm Nick! I have been programming since I was 16, graduated from CSU East Bay, with a
B.S. in Computer Science, and recently began my software engineering adventure with an internship
at [Dun & Bradstreet]. During the internship, I was formally offered a position on the Automation
team, and have since enjoyed learning and growing in this role alongside an amazing group of people.

Since joining, I have been brought onto the web app development team, where I am learning a ton about
what it takes to build and maintain a project and its infrastructure. I hope to write about some of
my design decisions on this project at some point in the near future.

I'll be honest, I am endlessly curious, and fuel said curiosity by tinkering on far too many personal
projects, researching topics such as (in no particular order) physics, space exploration, neuroscience,
virtual reality, artificial intelligence, operating systems, etc...

I enjoy making games, and participate in Ludum Dare as frequently as I can. My first hackathon
was Hack for Change 2012, where I assisted with the creation of LivePort. You can see more about my
projects [here](/projects/)!

I love my girlfriend Gabby very much!

I have been recommended a number of books to further develop my understanding of the culture and
history of software engineering, and fundamental computer science concepts. The following is
a list said books. This may be an attempt to keep myself accountable for actually going through
these. With seemingly so little free time, I will give myself any extra reason to improve my skills
by publishing this list to my website, and updating it regularly.

## In-Progress
- The Art of Unix Programming

## Future Reads
- Introduction to Algorithms
- Design Patterns
- The Pragmatic Programmer
- The C Programming Language
- The Art of Computer Programming
